<!-- The classList.toggle("circle") method is used to toggle the
     presence of a CSS class named "circle" on an HTML element's classList.

If the element already has the "circle" class,
 the toggle() method will remove it, and if the element doesn't have the "circle" class, it will add it. 
 Essentially, it toggles the class on and off.

This is useful when you want to dynamically change the appearance or behavior of an element based on user interaction or certain conditions. 
By toggling classes, you can control CSS styles or apply JavaScript logic accordingly. -->
